Hi!
I'm Isaac. A young coder from Britian, and Welcome to isaboo.co.uk. Here you can find games, puzzles, videos and more.

I enjoy making games, websites and videos.  
I make this website for _pure fun_ and to practice my coding skills. 

Some of you may be thinking: Hey! How do I do what this Isaac has done? Well it's quite easy to learn if you have the patience. You can easily find books which can teach you or you can use a website. I use [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) for reference all the time.

As well as what I just mentioned, I might be making some video tutorials on a future youtube channel so hang in there for those!

I hope you enjoy using this website. If you have any suggestions, requests, or complaints then [visit my contact page](/contact/).

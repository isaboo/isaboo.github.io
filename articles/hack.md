This trick is simple but will impress your friends to make them think your a hacker or to prank them. And it's quite a cool trick anyway!

#### _Notice_: This is not actually hacking!

Before we begin, make sure your using one of the following browsers:

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/search?q=Google%20Chrome)
- [The New Microsoft Edge](https://www.google.com/search?q=Microsoft%20Edge)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.google.com/search?q=Mozilla%20Firefox)
- Or any other [Chromium based browser](https://www.google.com/search?q=list%20of%20chromium%20browsers)

Screenshots from this tutorial will be from Google Chrome, since it's the most polular but the browsers listed all have an almost identical interface.

### Step 1: Launching the developer tools

First of all, [Click Here](/assets/other/devtoolsplayground.html){: target="_blank"}. This will contain every element needed for this article aswell as instrucions in the console.

Now right click anywhere on the page and select inspect. What just popped up is the Browser DevTools. We'll be using this alot soon.

### Step 2: Selecting an element.

- In the DevTools window, look for a little arrow symbol in the top left. It looks like this.  
![Pointer icon](/assets/images/pointer.png)

- Click on it and hover the mouse over the page.
- Hover the mouse over the 'This is some text to edit' text

- And click. It should flash in the devtools window.

### Step 3: Editing Text

- Right click on the highlighted code and select 'Edit as HTML'
- The part which appears white is what we want to change. Change it to anything you want.

I've spent the past couple of days researching and thinking of weird, crazy, spooky and possibly disturbing theories. If you wish to continue reading please read the following statements:
- Some may get you thinking, distracting you for the rest of the day.
- Some are pretty spooky
- Some will make your head hurt.

So are you ready?

Then let's get started.

## The NASA theorie.

This one is bound the spook you, maybe even a teency bit. But I _promise_ it will spook you!.

What does NASA stand for? "North American Space Agency" you possibly replied. If you didn't get that, then that's what NASA stands for. Well, nowerdays anyway. See back when NASA was first founded, it stood for "*North American **Sea** Agency*". It was an orginization for investigating the sea. Weird huh. But why did they suddenly change their motive?

We humans know more about the far reaches of outer space than we do about the depths of the ocean. It's crazy to think that we know less about 6 miles beneath the water, than we do about 
# _6,000,000,000,000_ miles away
That's a light year by the way!

But maybe there's a reason for that. 

Maybe governments around the world agreed that they would _not_ investigate the ocean. Or purposfully, make it a _very_ slow process to do so. And maybe thats because of what 'NASA' found in a secret mission to the depths of the ocean. Big enough and terrifying enough to leave it alone, and not go anywhere near it again.
